# Multi-Agent Demo for Restaurant Booking

## Overview

This project demonstrates a multi-agent system using CrewAI, where agents collaborate to handle restaurant booking requests. The system consists of three main agents:

1. **Customer Agent**: Requests a booking.
2. **Restaurant Agent**: Processes the booking request.
3. **Notification Agent**: Notifies the customer about the booking status.

- `main.py`: The entry point for the application.
- `agents.py`: Contains the definitions for the different agents.
- `tasks.py`: Contains the task definitions that the agents perform.
- `tools.py`: Placeholder for tools that agents might use (currently not utilized).
- `.env`: Environment variables for API keys.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

#### 1.1 Create a New Project Directory

```bash
mkdir multi-agent-demo
cd multi-agent-demo
```

#### 1.2 Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

#### 1.3 Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```plaintext
crewai==0.22.5
exa_py==1.0.9
langchain==0.1.13
python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 1.4 Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following content (replace placeholders with actual API keys):

```plaintext
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=your_openai_model_name
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
```

### 2. Run the Demo

Execute the `main.py` file to run the demo:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

### 3. Customization

You can customize the agents and tasks to better fit your needs. For example, you might want to add more specific tasks or agents that align with different APIs or use cases.

## Code Explanation

### `src/main.py`

This file loads the environment variables, initializes the agents and tasks, and kicks off the CrewAI system.

### `src/agents.py`

Defines the agents involved in the system:

- `Customer Agent`: Requests a booking.
- `Restaurant Agent`: Processes the booking.
- `Notification Agent`: Notifies the customer about the booking status.

### `src/tasks.py`

Defines the tasks that agents perform:

- `booking_task`: Task for the customer agent to request a booking.
- `process_booking_task`: Task for the restaurant agent to process the booking request.

### `src/tools.py`

This file is a placeholder for any tools that the agents might use. Currently, it is not utilized.

## Additional Tips

- **Documentation**: Refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory (if available) for more detailed information on using CrewAI.
- **Testing**: Make sure to test your setup thoroughly before any presentation or interview to ensure everything works as expected.
